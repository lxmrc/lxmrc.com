There's a difference between `&&` and `and` and `||` and `or` in Ruby (try saying this out loud).

The symbol versions are the familiar logical operators we all know and love, they work how you'd expect. The word form have a lower precedence and using them caused me unexpected issues. I'm just going to use the regular kind from now on.
