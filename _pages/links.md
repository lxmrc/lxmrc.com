## Reading

Online things I'd like to read at some point.

### [Think OS](http://greenteapress.com/thinkos/)
>Think OS is an introduction to Operating Systems for programmers.

### [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/)
>The Twelve-Factor App methodology is a methodology for building software-as-a-service applications. These best practices are designed to enable applications to be built with portability and resilience when deployed to the web.

### [Systems Design for Advanced Beginners](https://robertheaton.com/2020/04/06/systems-design-for-advanced-beginners/)
A quick rundown on systems design.

### [The Architecture of Open Source Applications](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html)
>In these two books, the authors of four dozen open source applications explain how their software is structured, and why. What are each program's major components? How do they interact? And what did their builders learn during their development? In answering these questions, the contributors to these books provide unique insights into how they think. 

This is definitely in the 'someday' pile.

## DIY

Projects that involve building your own version of something.

### [Rebuilding Rails](https://rebuilding-rails.com/)
>With Rebuilding Rails you'll build a complete Ruby MVC framework from an empty directory. Your framework will be structured like Rails, using the same architecture and the same metaprogramming tricks. You'll learn the magic behind Rails.

### [Building Git](https://shop.jcoglan.com/building-git/)
>Building Git is a deep dive into the internals of the Git version control system. By rebuilding it in a high-level programming language, we explore the computer science behind this widely used tool. In the process, we gain a deeper understanding of Git itself as well as covering a wide array of broadly applicable programming topics...

### [Rebuilding Redis in Ruby](https://redis.pjam.me/)
>This website is a free online book about rebuilding Redis in Ruby, from scratch. 

A work in progress -- 9 out of 16 chapters have been completed as of November 16, 2020.

### [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)
>This book contains everything you need to implement a full-featured, efficient scripting language. You’ll learn both high-level concepts around parsing and semantics and gritty details like bytecode representation and garbage collection. Your brain will light up with new ideas, and your hands will get dirty and calloused. It’s a blast.

### [Linux From Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/)
>Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a project that provides you with step-by-step instructions for building your own custom Linux system, entirely from source code.

Related and possibly based on LFS (I haven't gone through either yet) is [Build Your Own Linux](http://www.buildyourownlinux.com/) from Linux Academy. Leaving it here in case it turns out to be better.

### [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)
>This is an ambitious book attempting to give you a cohesive understanding of how everything in a computer works. Each chapter involves building a small piece of the overall system, from writing elementary logic gates in HDL, through a CPU and assembler, all the way to an application the size of a Tetris game.
