## About me

I’m Alex. I’m a Ruby developer based in Melbourne, Australia. This is where I blog about computers. 

I'm interested in :
  - Ruby, either on Rails or regular
  - Back-end development in particular
  - Linux, Docker, CI/CD and devops in general
  - Why learning is hard and how to do it better
